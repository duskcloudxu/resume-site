    "about": "From an early age, I’ve always been deeply interested in computer. When I was a child, I was absolutely attracted by computer games, but later it was the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do. Encumbered by the GaoKao (AKA National College Entrance Examination), I did not meet the programming until I entered into colleges. However, it does not prevent me from being fascinated with programming. During the university, I began to like the feeling of solving problems in the real world by coding, as well as the sense of achievement when I saw others’ acknowledgments under my technical blogs. The coding, eventually, became a part of my life. Therefore, in the future, I wish to pursue a deeper understanding of programming and the broader knowledge of computer science.",

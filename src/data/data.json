    "about": "From an early age I’ve always been deeply interested in computers. As a child, I was attracted by computers games, but was later attracted in the inner workings of the machines, why they worked and what else they were capable of. After getting into college, I was fascinated with programming. I love the feeling of solving problems in the real world through coding, as well as the sense of achievement from others’ acknowledgments under my technical blogs. The coding, eventually, became a part of my life. Therefore, in the future, I wish to pursue a deeper understanding of programming and the broader knowledge of computer science.",
